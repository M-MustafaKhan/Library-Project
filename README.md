# Library-Project
Working on a project to integrate all the functionalities of my Universities main college library into a website.
This project is my own idea and I am working on this project while simultaneously learning and improving my knowledge on Web Development.
My ultimate aim is to present my project to my Universities management when it is in its final phases and hope to add this to our college's main website.
All the code is written solely by me.
This is the first time I am working on any project of this scale and pushing it onto GitHub.
